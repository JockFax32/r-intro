# Educational cost

The data for this exercise comes from the U.S. Department of Education's [College Cost](https://collegecost.ed.gov/catc/Default.aspx) website. More specifically, it is the `TuitionChange` tab of the Excel document downloaded [here](https://collegecost.ed.gov/catc/resources/CATClists2014.xlsx).

In this exercise, you'll answer the following questions (as well as your own):

- What is the average annual tuition by sector in 2014?
- How did the cost of UW rank against other Washington schools?
- Which *sector* had the largest average change in tuition?
- Which state has the most higher-ed institutions?

The `analysis.R` is a partially completed version of this exercise that demonstrates how to begin working the the data. The answers are in the `analysis-complete.R` file.
